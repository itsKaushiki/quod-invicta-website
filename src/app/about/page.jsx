          Quod Invicta was founded in 2011 and was named as Invincibles and was rebranded in 2017 as Quod Invicta, Invicta is 'Invincibles' in Latin to keep the history of the team. Our main objective is to make clothing more of a lifestyle than something that is used to cover oneâ€™s body through engineering and collaborating with brands to create an awareness of sustainable clothing.
